Des:
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
(According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: 
  “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T
  that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”)
